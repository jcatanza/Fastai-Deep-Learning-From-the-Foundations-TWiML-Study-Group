    "### Debugger Commands\n",
    "From https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands recognized by the debugger are listed below. Most commands can be abbreviated to one or two letters as indicated; e.g. h(elp) means that either h or help can be used to enter the help command (but not he or hel, nor H or Help or HELP). Arguments to commands must be separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs). Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets ([]) in the command syntax; the square brackets must not be typed. Alternatives in the command syntax are separated by a vertical bar (|).\n",
    "\n",
    "Entering a blank line repeats the last command entered. Exception: if the last command was a list command, the next 11 lines are listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commands that the debugger doesn’t recognize are assumed to be Python statements and are executed in the context of the program being debugged. Python statements can also be prefixed with an exclamation point (!). This is a powerful way to inspect the program being debugged; it is even possible to change a variable or call a function. When an exception occurs in such a statement, the exception name is printed but the debugger’s state is not changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger supports aliases. Aliases can have parameters which allows one a certain level of adaptability to the context under examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple commands may be entered on a single line, separated by ;;. (A single ; is not used as it is the separator for multiple commands in a line that is passed to the Python parser.) No intelligence is applied to separating the commands; the input is split at the first ;; pair, even if it is in the middle of a quoted string.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a file .pdbrc exists in the user’s home directory or in the current directory, it is read in and executed as if it had been typed at the debugger prompt. This is particularly useful for aliases. If both files exist, the one in the home directory is read first and aliases defined there can be overridden by the local file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changed in version 3.2: .pdbrc can now contain commands that continue debugging, such as continue or next. Previously, these commands had no effect.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    Without argument, print the list of available commands. With a command as argument, print help about that command. help pdb displays the full documentation (the docstring of the pdb module).
