# TWiML Fastai "Deep Learning From the Foundations" Study Group

This repo is to share Jupyter notebooks, lecture slide decks and other curriculum materials that I am developing for the  TWiML Fastai "Deep Learning From the Foundations" Study Group aka "Practical Deep Learning for Coders Part 2"

Jupyter notebooks that I have annotated and otherwise modified bear the suffix '-jcat.ipynb'.

The study group meets remotely via Zoom on Saturdays at 8:45 AM Pacific time, from July 6, 2019 through November 9, 2019. We communicate on the TWiML Slack Group, on the #fastai_dl channel. Our use of the Slack and Zoom platforms is by courtesy of Sam Charrington, of TWiML (This Week in Machine Learning)

An up-to-date schedule is maintained at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/139XMd3moRb1C2No1XF5zN11Ivqm1XXXhEWNu2wcfTZc/edit#gid=339739437

Hope to see you at the next meetup!

The key to an optimal Fastai course experience is: don't be a spectator!  Unless you are learning from the course notebooks by spending time with them, running them and playing with them, you are a bystander, and you will miss out on getting the full benefit of the course.

Thus, the primary barrier to participation in the Fastai courses is setting up the infrastructure to run the course notebooks. There are many possibilities: if you have the necessary resources, you can run the notebooks locally on your own machine. Otherwise you can run the notebooks on Kaggle, on Google Colab, or on other cloud platforms such as paperspace, AWS, and crestle.

Currently the best cloud alternative for most people is Google Colab, which provides free access to CPU's GPU's and even TPU's (tensor processing units)! I have created a Jupyter notebook to guide you through the process of setting up to run the course notebooks  on Google Colab; you can run it directly from this repo via the URL

If you plan to participate in the course, please do this as a first priority!
