These helper functions manipulate text using the powerful syntax of `regular expressions` (sometimes abbreviated `regex`). Python's `re` library implements the language of `regular expressions`. On first encounter, the compact syntax of `re` can be a bit off-putting. It can be annoying, like trying to read a foreign language about which you have no clue. The brain becomes confused at its inability to parse as when reading words of its native language.\n",

) & sinking of the 747 ( maybe the makers were trying to cross the original xxmaj airport with another popular disaster flick of the period xxmaj the xxmaj poseidon xxmaj adventure ( 1972 ) ) & submerged is where it stays until the end with a stark dilemma facing those trapped inside , either suffocate when the air runs out or drown as the 747 floods or if any of the doors are opened & it 's a decent idea that could have made for a great little disaster flick but bad unsympathetic character 's , dull dialogue , lethargic set - pieces & a real lack of danger or suspense or tension means this is a missed opportunity . xxmaj while the rather sluggish plot keeps one entertained for 108 odd minutes not that much happens after the plane sinks & there 's not as much urgency as i thought there should have been . xxmaj even when the xxmaj navy become involved things do n't pick up that much with a few shots of huge ships & helicopters flying about but there 's just something lacking here . xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as the jinxed airline worker xxmaj joe xxmaj patroni is back but only gets a couple of scenes & barely even says anything preferring to just look worried in the background . \\n\\n xxmaj the home video & theatrical version of xxmaj airport ' 77 run 108 minutes while the us tv versions add an extra hour of footage including a new opening credits sequence , many more scenes with xxmaj george xxmaj kennedy as xxmaj patroni , flashbacks to flesh out character 's , longer rescue scenes & the discovery or another couple of dead bodies including the navigator . xxmaj while i would like to see this extra footage i am not sure i could sit through a near three hour cut of xxmaj airport ' 77 . xxmaj as expected the film has dated badly with horrible fashions & interior design choices , i will say no more other than the toy plane model effects are n't great either . xxmaj along with the other two xxmaj airport sequels this takes pride of place in the xxmaj razzie xxmaj award 's xxmaj hall of xxmaj shame although i can think of lots of worse films than this so i reckon that 's a little harsh . xxmaj the action scenes are a little dull unfortunately , the pace is slow & not much excitement or tension is generated which is a shame as i reckon this could have been a pretty good film if made properly . \\n\\n xxmaj the production values are alright if nothing spectacular . xxmaj the acting is n't great , two time xxmaj oscar winner xxmaj jack xxmaj lemmon has said since it was a mistake to star in this , one time xxmaj oscar winner xxmaj james xxmaj stewart looks old & frail , also one time xxmaj oscar winner xxmaj lee xxmaj grant looks drunk while xxmaj sir xxmaj christopher xxmaj lee is given little to do & there are plenty of other familiar faces to look out for too . \\n\\n xxmaj airport ' 77 is the most disaster orientated of the three xxmaj airport films so far & i liked the ideas behind it even if they were a bit silly , the production & bland direction does n't help though & a film about a sunken plane just should n't be this boring or lethargic . xxmaj followed by xxmaj the xxmaj concorde ... xxmaj airport ' 79 ( 1979 ) . xxeos\",\n",
